"""
test_context_validator.py

Validate TestContext subgraphs for LLM test generation.

Runs after TestContextExtractor.extract() to ensure the subgraph is:
  ✓ Structurally valid (no orphans, no broken edges, closed graph)
  ✓ Semantically meaningful (seeds connected, test coverage, proper types)
  ✓ LLM-friendly (good density, diverse edges, documented)

Errors block use; warnings flag issues to monitor.

        patch, back when patch resolution used diff-text/hunk scanning
        and could sweep an unrelated sibling's def line into the same
        hunk).

        Grouped by (label, class), not label alone: two DIFFERENT classes
        each having their own real, independently-and-correctly-resolved
        same-named method (e.g. both KMeans.fit and MiniBatchKMeans.fit
        genuinely changed by the same patch) is not a collision at all --
        each is already unambiguously scoped to its own class by
        PatchParser's real AST line ranges (kg_construction#75), which
        replaced the old diff-scanning approach specifically because it
        eliminates this false-positive-sweep failure mode at the source.
        Confirmed directly: #75's PatchParser can no longer reproduce the
        original #63 scenario at all (a real single-class patch only ever
        resolves to that one class's method) -- and confirmed via a full
        TestGenEval validation run that grouping by label alone wrongly
        rejected ~8% of real instances across django/matplotlib/astropy/
        pytest/scikit-learn/pylint/xarray, most tracing to real multi-class
        patches (and, via kg_construction#102, real nested classes that
        previously had no KG node, forcing seed lookup to fall back to
        every same-named method in the file, unfiltered).

        This is still an ERROR, not a warning, for the case it does catch:
        LLMSerializer._build_seed_section trusts seeds[0] unconditionally,
        so a GENUINE same-class or no-class collision means the model may
        be shown a completely unrelated function's code as if it were the
        one the patch actually changed, depending on subgraph node
        ordering (BFS visited-order, confirmed non-deterministic across
        runs during kg_construction#54's investigation).

        Distinct from a genuine multi-function patch (e.g.
        api_multi_verb_2012 changing patch/put/request/post together,
        which correctly produces multiple seeds with DIFFERENT labels):
        the signal here is specifically the same (label, class) resolving
        to more than one node, not "more than one seed" in general.

        A seed marked newly_created_file (kg_construction#93) is exempt
        regardless: for a wholly new file, EVERY symbol in it genuinely is
        changed/new, so even a same-class collision there (e.g. two
        overload-shaped methods) reflects the real post-patch source, not
        an unresolved lookup ambiguity.
